## Summary: 

From our analysis, there is no possibility of positive bias in the program. This is because we found 36percent of vine reviews are 5 stars, whereas 47% of non vine reviews were 5 stars. This helps to clarify that there is no bias towards vine paid reviews

For additional analysis, we can take a further deep dive to check other connected datasets or look at average ratings of paid versus unpaid reviews
